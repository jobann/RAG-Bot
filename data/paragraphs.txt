Title: The Little Lantern and the Lost Path
In a quiet village named Kalanaur which is surrounded by tall pine trees, there lived a small lantern named Lumo. Every night, Lumo helped travelers find their way home by lighting up the dark forest paths.
One evening, a young girl named Mira got lost while picking berries. The sky grew dark, and she couldn’t see the trail back. Lumo saw her from afar and gently floated toward her, glowing softly.
“Follow my light,” Lumo whispered. Mira smiled and followed the warm glow. The lantern guided her safely through the woods until she reached her village.
From that day on, Mira and Lumo became friends. Whenever anyone got lost, Mira would call for Lumo, and together they lit the way home.
